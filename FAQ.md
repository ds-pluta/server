## Shiny Server FAQ

1. What is R Shiny?
    + Shiny is a web-based platform for easily building interactive R apps.  Shiny 
    is especially good for the presentation and visualize of data.  For more information 
    on shiny, visit the [R Shiny homepage](http://shiny.rstudio.com) or refer to 
    the [Shiny cheatsheet](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/cheatsheet.html).
2. Who can use the UCI DSI Shiny Server?
    + The UCI DSI Shiny Server is provided for the use of UCI students and faculty to 
    present and promote their research and projects.
3. How can I deploy my app to the server?
    + Apps can be deployed via the "Deploy to Server" tab at the top of the page.  Currently, 
    apps must be hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com) for deployment.  GitHub is a free 
    version control system and repository for source code.
4. What are app size limits?
    + Server resources are limited.  Apps and required data should be limited to 50 MB.  Larger 
    apps are likely to have poor performance when hosted on the server.
